## Introduction
This is application, which i made for my Engineer Thesis purpose. The application allows user to create a bicycle event, along with specifying data such as: name of the event, description, starting place, planned destination (with visualization on the map), event type, recommended bike type and pace. Other users can take part in the created event and communicate with each other by means of comments. The application has a system for searching and filtering trips, based on, among others distance to the starting point, distance, difficulty level, as well as the user reputation system. Each of them has their own profile that can be personalized.
The application was developed in the Android Studio environment, using the Java language. The Firebase platform was used to store and process data about events and users.
